                Key components are various dials to control relevant settings: soil level for extent of clean 
                needed, wash temp for water temperature, load type, rinse options, and water level. These should all 
                be used in conjunction to configure the machine for optimal wash settings as to properly wash while

                Observations & Interviews
            </h2>
            <p> This section details close observations and conversational interviews conducted with users of the washing machine to understand 
                their experience, expectations, motives, and challenges. 
                <div id="small-spacer"></div>
                The following are my key observations regarding users' patterns in their 
                interaction with the interface, sorted by differentiating observations and similar patterns in interactions: 
            </p>
              <ul id="observations-list" class="px-5 py-4">
                <li>
                    <b>Varying speeds with which users interacted with key settings:</b>
                    user 1 took almost no time, just setting the load to normal, user 2 took a lot more time, considering each slowly, 
                    while user 3 took less time than user 2, but considered settings more than user 1 
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Varying accuracy with when returned to the machine to see if load completed: </b>
                     user 1 was almost completely accurate, user 2 was 15 minutes early then 15 minutes late, and user 3 was 20 minutes late
                     - causing negative facial reactions, more so than any other part of the process 
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Pods vs detergent: </b>
                    user 1 used a pod, user 2 used both, and user 3 used just liquid detergent
                </li>
                  <div id="small-spacer"></div>
                  <div id="small-spacer"></div>
                <li>
                  <b>Neutral reactions: </b>
                  reactions when setting interface settings initially were mostly neutral
                </li>
                <li>
                    Consistently, the water level setting was never touched
                </li>
                <li>
                    Each person followed a <b>standard order of operations:</b>
                    users opened the lid, put their clothes in with relative ease, put detergent (either a pod or liquid), closed the lid, 
                    set settings in less than a minute, then started the load, overall taking an average of a minute and a half
                </li>
                
              </ul> 
            <div id="small-spacer"></div>
            <p> The following are questions that I asked: </p>
            <ol id="questions-list" class="px-5 py-4">
                <b><li>
                    What is your name, how old are you, and how long have you been doing your laundry?
                </li>
                <li>
                    Describe your laundry process: how do you decide you need to do laundry, when do you do it and how often, how long does it take you,
                    and what are you most commonly washing? 
                </li>
                <li>
                    How does your experience using this washing machine interface compare to others you might’ve used in the past? If you’ve never used one before, 
                    how was the process of first using the machine? 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Is there anything most notable about the design of this machine: any features, control panel settings, or settings that come to mind? 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Have you faced any challenges using the interface that’ve caused you to want to change something about it: is there anything most 
                    notably absent from the design of this machine? 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Would you recommend the design of this laundry machine to other washing machine developers? 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Anything else you'd like to add? 
                </li>
                </b>
            </ol>
            <div id="small-spacer"></div>
            <p> This is a summary hilighting main points and important patterns from the responses: </p>
            <ul id="interview-resp-list" class="px-5 py-4">
                <li>
                    Every person has a <b>behavioral and emotional routine associated with laundry</b> in terms of when they decide and how they do it: 
                    user 1 considers it very procedural and chore-like, hence their hastened and cyclical once-a-week, after work process; user 2 enjoys taking care of their clothes 
                    and devotes a morning at home to do two loads to start the day; user 3 allows sporadic desires to clean or practical considerations of running out of clean clothes to run large loads to finish as quick as possible.
                </li>
                <div id="small-spacer"></div>
                <li>
                    The design of this machine is <b>more complex, customizable, and effective than what users had experienced before</b>, 
                    specifically comparing to standard dorm washing machines. Every person noted that this machine was better than the dorms’. 
                </li>
                <div id="small-spacer"></div>
                <li>
                    <b>Slower speeds at which each person chose settings</b> and their appreciation for a variety of settings <b>both correlate to a deeper relationship with clothes themselves</b>: user 2, who took the longest to choose settings, 
                    noted the various options for loads, and most emphatically noted hatred of the dorm machines, indicated the most care for their clothing,
                    while user 1, who took less than 10 seconds for the entire order of operations, noted a cyclical wardrobe of repeating sweatshirts and t-shirts 
                    that they didn’t care much about.
                </li>   
                <div id="small-spacer"></div> 
                <li>
                    <b>Independent and interactive dials allow users with varying preferences and depth of experience ease of use and function: </b>
                    user 1 did not care to specify settings and was still able to start load easily, user 2 could specify and noted that it 
                    seemed easy to understand for new users, and user 3 noted that other machines have default settings for each type of load, 
                    but independent dials in this machine allow users ease of customization. 
                </li>
                <div id="small-spacer"></div>
                <li>
                    Most <b>notable frustrations include lack of indicator of load duration, compartment for detergent, and a max fill indicator for load size,</b>
                    features repeatedly considered missing that could improve the design and overall effectiveness.

                        but doesn’t want to mess them up. She also needs more cotton t-shirts, jeans, and underclothes which
